Version 1.1 
- Eight photorealistic textured buildings from the industrial sawmill environment. Models are suitable for any type games. They use one material with set textures (diffuse+normalmap).
- Each model has prepared two mapping coordinates. One for the diffuse map and second for the custom light map (so uw strips dosen´t overlap). Coordinates were made manually for best quality.
- The textures are imported at 1024x1024 to speed up the import process, but the original files are 2048x2048 and can be re-imported at that size for higher quality.
